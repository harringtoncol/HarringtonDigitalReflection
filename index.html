    <p>The digital poster I created merges the course concepts of physical internet infrastructure, digital colonialism as well as Content Moderation. 
Internet Infrastructure is represented in this poster through the underwater sea cables stretching from the ocean in the east that are represented as the trains that are spreading west. The cable that Elon Musk is spreading is represented as internet and Wi-Fi westward. However, a key piece in this digital poster is the individuals in the bottom right. Although they are in the “light” (Developed area) have no access to internet but wish they had it as represented by the lack of internet in their home and their sad faces. They are being overlooked by the corporations that are spreading technology westward because it doesn’t make monetary sense to provide for them. This is representative of the significant amount of Americans that don’t have access to internet that are being ignored. 
The digital colonialism is represented throughout the poster. The background of the image is the famous American Progress painting which is an 1872 painting by John Gast that is often used as a representation of Manifest Destiny and the white man’s burden. However instead of a push westward it now represents bringing internet to the “uncivilized” and “undeveloped” whether they want it or not.  Big tech companies are driving the push to underdeveloped areas as they want looking for more markets to make money from, this is represented by Facebook and Amazon driving carts west towards the darkness with Elon Musk the angel leading the charge with the Tesla star on his brow. 
Finally content moderation is included in this digital poster as the sun that spreads its light on the east is the content moderator teacher explaining what pictures are okay from the video we viewed in class. All the light of the internet and technology is provided by the content moderators that never get any credit but make it a safe and enjoyable place to be for everyone else.
