    <p>The digital poster I created merges the course concepts of physical internet infrastructure, digital colonialism as well as content moderation. 
Internet Infrastructure is represented throughout this poster. First the trains as the basis of the poster represent the spread of colonists westward. They have been substituted with underwater cables to represent how all of the internet is built through the infrastructure of underwater sea cables. Anywhere that needs internet currently must have underwater cables connecting it to the rest of the world. A key piece in this digital poster are the individuals in the bottom right. The right side of this poster represents the developed area vs the left side that represents the undeveloped area that are still in the darkness. Although these individuals are in the right side of the poster, they have no access to internet but wish they had it as represented by the lack of internet in their home and their sad faces. They are being overlooked by the corporations that are spreading technology westward because it doesn’t make monetary sense to provide for them. This is representative of the significant number of Americans who don’t have access to the internet that are being ignored. 
The digital colonialism is represented throughout the poster. The background of the image is the famous American Progress painting which is an 1872 painting by John Gast that is often used as a representation of Manifest Destiny and the white man’s burden. However, instead of a push westward it now represents bringing internet to the “uncivilized” and “undeveloped” whether they want it or not.  Big tech companies are driving the push to underdeveloped areas as they want to expand their markets. This is represented by Facebook and Amazon driving carts west towards the darkness with Elon Musk the angel leading the charge with the Tesla star on his brow as he brings Wi-Fi connection with him. 
Finally content moderation is included in this digital poster as the sun that spreads its light on the east. The sun has been replaced by the content moderator teacher explaining what pictures are okay from the video we viewed in class. All the light of the internet and technology is provided by the content moderators that never get any credit but make it a safe and enjoyable place to be for everyone else. 
The entire poster represents the idea of technology being the solution to everything while ignoring the struggles beneath the surface. The large tech companies push the idea of technology being the light and the salvation for people who do not have it. However, an underlining element of this digital poster are the issues and problems technology can cause. Many aren’t aware of the large number of Americans who are without internet access. They also aren’t aware of how important content moderators are in making the internet a safe place to be or how difficult the job can be for the moderators and how much emotional damage it can cause.
